<h1>seleniumQuery IE Driver - ActiveX blocked</h1>

<p>Your IE Driver issued an error during a legitimate interaction with seleniumQuery.</p>
<p><b>This is probably due to ActiveX being blocked.</b></p>
<p>Enable it through <b>Internet Options</b> or <b>click in the button below (IE11)</b> to enable
it just for this test. seleniumQuery is currently sleeping and will wait up to 45 seconds. If you don't
enable ActiveX (a.k.a click the button below) within this time frame, the test will
fail with some misleading exception message.</p>
